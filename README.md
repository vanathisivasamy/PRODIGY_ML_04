# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a hand gesture recognition model. The goal is to develop a system that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. Hand gesture recognition has applications in intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## Kaggle Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the hand gesture recognition model is sourced from Kaggle. It includes a collection of labeled images or video frames, each depicting various hand gestures.

Please download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the code.

## Model Used
We have implemented a deep learning model for hand gesture recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image-related tasks, and they are particularly effective for recognizing patterns in image data. The model will be trained to learn and recognize the distinctive features of different hand gestures.

The performance of the model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, and it can be fine-tuned for better accuracy.
